# Capstone Project: Real-Time Seat Occupancy Status System for Workspaces (classrooms, libraries, workshops, corporate offices)
The project aims to implement a comprehensive system that effectively manages seating within premises by providing real-time seat occupancy status and analytics for efficient space utilisation. By leveraging live CCTV footage and employing object detection techniques, the system will offer accurate information on seat availability, thereby facilitating a seamless experience for individuals seeking available seating. Also, the management staff will get access to important data and analytics to manage the premises more efficiently.
